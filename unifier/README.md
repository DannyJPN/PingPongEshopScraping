# Unifier

Unifier is a Python-based tool designed to consolidate and standardize product data from multiple e-shop CSV exports into a unified format. It processes product information through various stages of normalization, attribute extraction, and validation, making it compatible with different e-commerce platforms and marketing services.

## Overview

The application is built with a modular architecture, utilizing Python's object-oriented programming capabilities. It implements parallel processing for efficient data handling and includes comprehensive logging and progress tracking.

### Key Technologies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas (for CSV processing)
- concurrent.futures (for parallel execution)
- tqdm (for progress tracking)
- BeautifulSoup4 (for HTML processing)
- OpenAI API (for intelligent data extraction)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Access to OpenAI API (for intelligent processing features)

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Prepare the Memory directory:
- Ensure all required memory files are present in the Memory/ directory
- Verify language configurations in SupportedLanguagesList.txt

5. Run the script:
```bash
python unifier.py [options]
```

Available options:
- `--language`: ISO 639-1 language code (default: CS)
- `--result-dir`: Result directory (default: H:/Desaka)
- `--memory-dir`: Memory directory (default: ./Memory/)
- `--export-dir`: Export directory (default: H:/Desaka/Results)
- `--confirm-ai`: Enable/disable AI result confirmation (default: true)
