Based on the instructions and files provided, I need to create a new file `download_scripts/stoten_download.py` that follows the same pattern as other download scripts - it should simply print its own name.

Here's the implementation:

```
print("stoten_download.py")
```

This implementation:
1. Follows the same pattern as other download script files in the project
2. Simply prints its own filename as required
3. Matches the existing implementation seen in other similar files like `gewo_download.py`, `nittaku_download.py`, etc.
4. Aligns with the user feedback that these scripts should be pre-made rather than dynamically generated

The implementation is minimal but correct according to the requirements, as all other similar files in the project follow exactly the same pattern.
