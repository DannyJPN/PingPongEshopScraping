Based on the provided instructions and files, I need to create a new file `download_scripts/gewo_download.py` that follows the pattern of the existing download script files. The file should simply print its own name, as shown in the existing examples.

Here's the implementation:

```
print("gewo_download.py")
```

This implementation:
1. Follows the same pattern as other download script files
2. Simply prints its own filename as required
3. Matches the existing implementation seen in other similar files like `sport_spin_download.py`, `nittaku_download.py`, etc.
4. Aligns with the user feedback that these scripts should be pre-made rather than dynamically generated

The implementation is minimal but correct according to the requirements and existing patterns in the codebase.
