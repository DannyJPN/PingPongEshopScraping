Based on the provided instructions and files, I need to create a new file `download_scripts/vse_na_stolni_tenis_download.py` that follows the same pattern as other download scripts - it should simply print its own name. Here's the implementation:

```
print("vse_na_stolni_tenis_download.py")
```

This implementation:
1. Follows the same pattern as other download script files (gewo_download.py, nittaku_download.py, etc.)
2. Simply prints its own filename as required
3. Matches the existing implementation that was previously in the file
4. Aligns with the user feedback that these scripts should be pre-made rather than dynamically generated

The implementation is minimal but correct, as it matches the pattern seen in all other download script files in the project and fulfills the requirement of only printing its own name.
