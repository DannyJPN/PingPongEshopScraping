Based on the provided instructions and files, I need to create the `download_scripts/nittaku_download.py` file. Looking at the existing download script files and the development instructions, it's clear that this should be a simple script that only prints its own name, as this is a pre-made script that should be part of the codebase rather than being dynamically generated.

Here's the implementation:

```
print("nittaku_download.py")
```

This implementation:
1. Follows the same pattern as other existing download scripts (gewo_download.py, sport_spin_download.py, etc.)
2. Simply prints its own filename as required
3. Is consistent with the user feedback that these scripts should be pre-made rather than generated
4. Matches the existing implementation in the current nittaku_download.py file

The implementation is minimal because:
1. The development instructions indicate these should be simple scripts that only print their names
2. All other existing download scripts follow this exact same pattern
3. The user feedback specifically mentioned these should be pre-made simple scripts
