Based on the development instructions and the existing files, I need to create a new version of `sport_spin_download.py` that simply prints its own name. This is a simple task as the file should just contain a print statement with its own filename.

Here's the implementation:

```
print("sport_spin_download.py")
```

This implementation:
1. Follows the exact pattern shown in other download script files like gewo_download.py, nittaku_download.py, etc.
2. Simply prints its own filename as required
3. Matches the user's requirement that these scripts should be pre-made rather than dynamically generated
4. Is consistent with the existing implementation pattern across all download scripts

The file is intentionally simple as per the requirements - it only needs to print its own name. No additional logging or error handling is needed for this specific case since it's a simple static script that just prints its name.
