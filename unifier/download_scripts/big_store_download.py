Based on the instructions and existing files, I need to create a new file `download_scripts/big_store_download.py` that follows the same pattern as other download script files - it should simply print its own name.

Here's the implementation:

```
print("big_store_download.py")
```

This implementation:
1. Follows the same pattern as other download script files (gewo_download.py, nittaku_download.py, etc.)
2. Simply prints its own filename as a string
3. Matches the requirement that these scripts should be pre-made rather than dynamically generated
4. Is consistent with the existing codebase

The script is intentionally simple as it's meant to be a placeholder that just prints its own name, matching the pattern seen in all other similar download scripts in the project.
